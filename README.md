Dataset Information:
- the dataset `drug_safety.csv` was obtained from [Hbiostat](https://hbiostat.org/data/) courtesy of the Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics
- contained five adverse effects (`headache`, `abdominal pain`, `dyspepsia`, `upper respiratory infection`, `chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD)`) summarized into one variable (`adverse effect`) reflecting presence or absence of an adverse effect
- other information include: demographic data, vital signs, lab measures, etc. 
- the ratio of drug observations to placebo observations is 2 to 1
